                      For optimal results, we recommend using the cognitive training exercises 3-5 times per week, for about 15-20 minutes per session. Consistency is more important than duration. Regular, shorter sessions are more effective than occasional longer ones. Our daily challenges feature is designed to help you maintain a consistent training schedule.

                    <AccordionContent>
                      Our stroke risk prediction model is based on established risk factors from large epidemiological studies. While it provides a good estimate of relative risk, it&apos;s important to understand that it&apos;s a statistical tool and not a medical diagnosis. The prediction should be used as one part of a comprehensive approach to health management, and we always recommend discussing your results with a healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.

                    <AccordionContent>
                      Our comprehensive cognitive assessment evaluates multiple domains of cognitive function, including:
                      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>Memory (working memory, short-term recall)</li>

                      </ul>
                      The assessment takes about 15-20 minutes to complete and provides a detailed breakdown of your performance across these domains, compared to age-matched norms when available.

                      Research suggests that targeted cognitive training can improve performance on specific cognitive tasks. There is evidence for near transfer (improvement in similar tasks to those trained) and some evidence for far transfer (improvement in untrained tasks) in certain conditions.

                      While cognitive training alone has not been definitively proven to prevent dementia or Alzheimer&apos;s disease, there is evidence that a multifaceted approach to brain health may reduce risk or delay onset. The concept of &quot;cognitive reserve&quot; suggests that mentally stimulating activities throughout life can help the brain better cope with pathological changes associated with dementia.

However, we caution against any claims of &quot;preventing&quot; neurodegenerative diseases, as these conditions have complex, multifactorial causes that are still being researched.</p>
